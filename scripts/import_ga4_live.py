"""
Import GA4 data directly from BigQuery into AntMart staging tables.

This script connects to the GA4 public sample dataset in BigQuery using the
Google Cloud BigQuery client. It fetches the tables required for AntMart
(e.g. events and items tables) and transforms them to match the AntMart
staging contracts. Requires authentication via a service account key JSON
file and a project ID configured in the .env file.

To use this script:
    1. Set DATA_SOURCE=ga4_live in your .env file.
    2. Provide GA4_PROJECT_ID and GA4_CREDENTIALS_JSON_PATH in .env.
    3. Run: python scripts/import_ga4_live.py

This file currently contains placeholder code only. You can extend it by
importing google.cloud.bigquery and using the client to query the GA4
dataset. See the Google Cloud documentation for details.
